                <p class="mb-4">"I cannot even emphasize enough what a godsend Michael was for us. He answered me quickly and visited us in a timely manner. He did an initial visit and plugged up holes all over the apartment, he sealed off everything. Since he left 3 months ago, we have not seen one mouse. Not one poop, no sighting of any sign of a mouse. "</p>

                <p class="mb-4">I was totally fed up. All of the construction in my area caused the rats to infest our area, they were eating our car wires, running rapidly through our yard and terrorizing my family. I  called up Mike and he was so knowledgeable and efficient.  I  was so pleased that I have him on a monthly schedule! He is family now!</p>

He confirmed the time the day before, came on time, and exterminated all areas and even found and exterminated the mice that had also gotten in to the place. Weeks later we are pest free! Michael followed up to make sure he had taken care of the issues and has been professional and so kind throughout the very upsetting process. I would highly recommend him!"</p>

I had no idea what to do. I tried a few times to fix the issue on my own but I was bitten by some of the wasps and they didn't go away.

I called Mike and he came out about one day after I called him to remove the problem. He was willing to come out late in the evening just to make sure he could take care of the issue ASAP. He also followed up immediately after the job was done to make sure there were no remaining wasps. He was extremely professional, knowledgeable & diligent while treating the problem area. The wasps are gone and I can get back to using my backyard again."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">"I've been using Cobble Hill exterminators for various projects and properties for about 5 years now. Michael, the owner, is incredibly knowledgeable, polite, trustworthy and professional. It's like having a cousin in the business. I recently had a mouse infestation due to a construction project and Michael went above and beyond to eradicate it with success. He is also sensitive to special requests, like using environmentally friendly products or more humane treatments if the customer requests, as my tenant did. You just don't get this level of service and expertise at reasonable rates in New York City, but you do with Cobble Hill Exterminators. I also appreciate the way I never feel rushed or uninformed. Michael is always happy and willing to communicate exactly what is happening. And he does it all with a smile and a great attitude. It is actually a pleasure having him around and you can't put a price on that. Top notch all around."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">"We had a large rat infestation in our backyard and in our adjoining neighbor's yards as well. Michael came in a couple of hours and spend at least three hours on the initial visit seeking out rat borrows and nests. He came back several times over the next few weeks for follow-ups. Today we're rat free and so are our neighbors, thanks to Michael. He advised our neighbors how to upkeep their property to prevent the rodents from returning. He listens carefully and truly cares about the task at hand. His fees are very reasonable, He is very friendly and trustworthy. He goes about his business with a smile on his face. He is not just a worker, he's the owner too. I highly recommend him."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">"I live in a floor-through in an old Brownstone in Carrol Gardens. I know Michael because he comes about once a month and sprays all the apartments in the building. He's been doing this for years.

Micheal is the sort of guy who is super warm and very respectful. If my 3yr old is napping and he arrives, we tiptoe around the apartment whispering so as not to wake her up.Just recently I had a mouse. So I called Michael up and had him come over. We talked about what we could do since the building is so old and I hate traps. We eventually decided to go over the entire apartment to "seal" all the significant holes and cracks (after we knew the mouse was not around). He did it with a combination of foam/steel wool/and brown caulking (to blend into the floorboards). It took several hours, and the work was excellent. His attention to detail was very clean and nearly invisible.

I can't recommend Michael enough. He's very affordable, he's grown up in the neighborhood, and loves to help his fellow residents."</p>
